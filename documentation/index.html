                    The technology stack implemented to create the digital interview assistant was a bit of a journey to find.  Initially the implementation of a refitted state of the art machine learning model GPT 2 seemed like the best course of action. however to conduct the transfer learning required to convert even the simplest GPT 2 model into a conversational AI chat bot would either take weeks of training With Google co-laboratories or break the project budget by requiring training on an 8 strong cluster of V100 GPS Which at the time of writing are some of the best on the market.
                    After researching into natural language processing there are several pre-existing open source AI frameworks available to use. The one that resonated best with the project is Rasa: the open source AI conversational chat bot.</p>
                    <p class="col2-3">Raza is fantastic software development toolkit that allows for the creation of customized conversational Ai. Raza has three stages of development the first being the NLU development or natural language understanding. Rasas NLU is a customizable pipeline of natural language processing models Offering two preconfigured pipelines the first being Pretrained_embeddings_Spacey or supervised embeddings. For the digital assistant 
                    Supervised-embeddings was chosen, as even though it takes longer to train, it gives better output on custom data.</p>
                    <p class="col2-3">The second stage is the Rasa Core. This the the implementation of the NLU model it allows for the creation of custom actions in Python, story and policy creation in markdown .md and domain configuration in yml.</p>
                    <p class="col2-3">The final stage of its development is Raza X which is almost a separate offering from the Raza team rasa X is a CI/CD Compute cluster configurable is either Kubernetes cluster or as a docker swarm it allows for scalable implementation applications built using the Raza SDK it also offers end to end testing.</p>               
                    <p class="col2-3">For the VR Environment within the frontend of the application the AFrame library was utilized. Much like unity, AFrame is a 3d engine however AFrame is powered by three.js and webgl. It Creates 3-dimensional environment in the browser that is accessible by any virtual reality device connected to the Internet as well as PC's laptops and mobile devices. It is lightweight, fast, efficient and allows development in HTML JavaScript and JSX.  
                        <p class="col2-3">To handle voice input from the user, the browsers native speech recognition API was implemented. this is a JavaScript class that takes user input from speech and converts it to text. In the same manner, for speech synthesis there is a similar JavaScript class available from the browser’s audio API, this is implemented as the voice of the digital interview assistant. These features are available in most browsers
                            <p class="col2-3">For users Uncomfortable with dictating, without a microphone or speakers there is a chat widget located in the bottom right corner of the application. </p> 
                            <p class="col2-3">The application is hosted on a Google Cloud VM Instance and on the Netlify Content delivery network with the back end in the front end coupled via socket IO over HTTPS. With the Domain https://digitalinterveiw.nz configured for the backend and CName address pointer  http://cv.digitalinterveiw.nz or https://infallible-ritchie-7fce2c.netlify.app/ for the front-end
                                </p>
                                <p class="col2-3">3D assets Can currently be slow loading on the web, especially when compared to the speed that 2D graphics can be rendered by large JavaScript frameworks such as Ember, Angular and React which can command full use of the browser's rendering engine to display 2D pages with lightning speed. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="col2-3">
                                    When it comes to rendering for three dimensions in  virtual reality ,were a high frame rate is what makes the experience stand out and a low frame rate tends to lead toward motion sickness, it is the excess of framework  load times and the great tools that allow complex state management that slow down the performance the of render. 
                                </p>
                                    <p class="col2-3">The proof of concept for the digital interview assistant has been achieved. By applying a range of learned technology’s, there is a 3-dimensional virtual reality environment, deployed between two cloud platforms where in a user can interact in a conversational manner with a digital avatar, to achieve a workplace goal.
                                                      Having reached the proof of concept there is room for the project to grow, as there is with any startup close to its inception. The minimal viable product is not far off with further development this digital interview assistant, could provide immense business value to its customers and a valuable return on investment to its developers. With the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning growing by the minute perhaps leveraging that intelligence, so that you stand out as the best option is the key to staying ahead.
